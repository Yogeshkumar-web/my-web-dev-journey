// Fetch API: The Fetch API is a modern browser feature that allows you to make HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to servers. It returns a Promise, which resolves to the response.

// Promises: A Promise is a JavaScript object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

// Async/Await : async and await are syntactic sugar over Promises to make asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.
