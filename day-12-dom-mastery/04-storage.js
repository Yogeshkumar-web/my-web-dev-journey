// local vs session storage

/*

=> localStorage and sessionStorage are web storage mechanisms provided by the browser that allow you to store keyâ€“value pairs locally in a user's browser.

1. localStorage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.

2. sessionStorage lasts only for the duration of the page session (until the tab is closed).

Note: Both follow the same API and only store data in string format.
